summary: "<div><p>Tired of fast food and deliveries? Sometimes, the urge to have something\
  \ fancy is just too hard to beat! Let's turn to a recipe book. There's a lot of\
  \ recipes in the book, and all of them are so appetizing. The search for the best\
  \ recipe can take quite a while. Let's automate this to save time and a great deal\
  \ of effort. Create a web service with Flask that allows storing, retrieving, updating,\
  \ and deleting recipes. By creating this app, you will be able to fetch recipes\
  \ in seconds. All you have to do is to choose the best recipe from the pre-uploaded\
  \ list of possible recipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team of creators of this project is\
  \ aware that the project now may contain some inaccuracies and possibly bugs, so\
  \ we do not recommend to choose this project to those who are not ready for that,\
  \ but we will be very happy if you choose it and help us with its improvement with\
  \ your comments, reports and feedback!</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"\
